The main kind of other frame related to our traffic we observe here is the IEEE 802.11 Acknowledgement. Each ping request/reply has an Acknowledgement immediately following it (e.g. Acknowledgement in packet 2261 following ping request in packet 2260).
%The frames other than data (data being QoS Null, Null and Data) are the following. Note that not all of these were packets related to what we were doing.
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Action, ie 4380
%\item Request-To-Send packet 2294
%\item Clear-To-Send packet 2295
%\item 802.11 Block Ack 2544
%\item Acknowledgement, ie 2259
%\item Probe Response ie 2601
%\item Probe Request ie 2740
%\item data = icmp ??
%\item neighbour discovery stuff?
%\item VHT NDP Announcement ie 716
%\end{itemize}


% There are three main types of frames observed, but each can be divided into separate subtypes.
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Management frames
% \begin{itemize}
%
% \item Probe Request (e.g. 15, for SSID UAntwerpen)
% \item Beacon Frame (e.g. 29, for SSID UAntwerpen)
%
% \item Probe response (e.g. 313, for SSID wmn-1-A)
% \item Action (e.g. 1172)
% \end{itemize}
%
% \item Control frames
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Request-to-send (e.g. 1)
% \item Clear-to-send (e.g. 7)
% \item 802.11 Block Ack (e.g. 4)
% \item Acknowledgement (e.g. 9)
% \end{itemize}
% \end{itemize}
% There were also some 802.11ac-specific frames such as the VHT NDP Announcement (e.g. 12)
