The RTS/CTS exchange in packets 1611 and 1612 protects the ping request from STA3 to STA1 in packet 1613. The first ping exchange (e.g. packet 438) did not have RTS/CTS protection. With only 156bytes they did not exceed the 1000byte RTS threshold.\\
In general, packets that exceed 1000 bytes in size are protected by RTS/CTS in this configuration. In this case this was exactly the 10 ICMPv6 packets involved in the second ping exchange.
