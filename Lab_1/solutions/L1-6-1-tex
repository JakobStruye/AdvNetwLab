On the trace file captured on STA1, the ping requests are duplicates as well as some Neighbor advertisements and some neighbor sollicitations being duplicates.\\
The ping requests in traces/L1-5-1.STA1.pcap are those packets with number 3,4 and 6,7. \\ \\
Neighbor advertisements in 10,11 and 16,17 are captured twice as well as the neighbor solicitations in 12,13.\\
Everything that is sent by STA1 appears in the dump file twice.\\ \\
Similarly, for the STA2 dump in traces/L1-5-1.STA2.pcap, everything that is sent by STA2 is duplicated. \\
In this case, that means the neighbor advertisement in 2,3; the ping replies in 5,6 and 8,9; the neighbor solicitation in 10,11, the neighbor advertisement in 14,15 and the neighbor solicitation in 16,17.
