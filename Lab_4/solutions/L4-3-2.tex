WEP encrypted the Logical Link Control header and everything in Layer 3 and above. In for example packet 1408 only the IEEE 802.11 header is readable. The LLC header, IP header and ICMP header + data are all combined into one encrypted data field. Analogously, in the ARP request in packet 1408 the LLC header and ARP fields are encrypted.
