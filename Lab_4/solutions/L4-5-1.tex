The encrypted frame types are largely the same as with WEP. In our dump file, /traces/L4-5-1.STA2.pcap, we observed Multicast Listener Report Messages (packet 207), Neighbor Solicitations (packet 222), Router Solicitations (packet 256) and of course the ping requests (packet 348) and replies (packet 354). The only type we did observe with WEP but not here is ARP. This is unsurprising as ARP is not used with IPv6.
